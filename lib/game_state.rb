# GameState represents a tic-tac-toe game at a moment in time between turns. The
# numbers 1-9 represent blank spaces on a board numbered as follows:
#
# 1 2 3
# 4 5 6
# 7 8 9
#
# As moves are taken, the numbers are replaced with the players' respective
# letters. After two turns the board might look like this:
#
# 1 2 X
# 3 4 5
# 6 7 Ã˜
