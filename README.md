# Tic Tac Toe

A basic text-based implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe.

I just re-read POODR by Sandi Metz, so I tried to apply concepts from that book
along the way.

Feel free to an open issue if you encounter any bugs.

## To run 🏃‍♀️

```sh
cd ttt-recurse
ruby tic_tac_toe.rb
```

## Future Improvements 🧹

- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Create a builder for `TicTacToe` to simplify initialization
- [ ] Ask if player wants to play again
- [ ] Create a `SmartMovePlayer`
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy
- [ ] Add a `GUI` -- React?
